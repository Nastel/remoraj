### Overview
This repository contains the PlantsByWebSphere Java EE sample application. There are two versions of the sample application. The master branch contains the original version of PlantsByWebSphere, while the rest branch contains an updated version which is still under development.

### Original
The original version of PlantsByWebSphere is a simple Java EE application which uses CDI managed beans, Java Server Faces (JSF), and Java Server Pages (JSP). The sample runs on both TWAS and Liberty.

### Updated
The updated version of PlantsByWebSphere replaces components of the original with a more modern web application design. JSF and JSP have been replaced by JAX-RS with the application redesigned as a RESTful Web Service. The client is a simple bootstrap framework, and all client JavaScript can be found in application.js. The server's additional REST code can be found in ApplicationResource.java.

Additionally, this new version supports the use of the javaMail-1.5 feature which requires the configuration of a mailSession object in the server.xml. Below is an example mailSession configuration. Make sure to modify the the mail account (Gmail, Yahoo, etc.) settings and allow access of less secure applications in order for it to connect with PlantsByWebSphere.

```xml
<mailSession description="Test of Mail for PBW" from="youremailaddress@gmail.com" host="smtp.gmail.com" jndiName="mail/PlantsByWebSphere" mailSessionID="PBWMailTest" password="password" storeProtocol="imaps" transportProtocol="smtp" user="youremailaddress@gmail.com">
<property name="mail.smtp.auth" value="true"/>
<property name="mail.smtp.starttls.enable" value="true"/>
<property name="mail.smtp.port" value="587"/>
<property name="mail.smtp.ssl.trust" value="smtp.gmail.com">
</property>
</mailSession>
```
